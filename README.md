This repo contains the Arduino code for a custom-built quadcopter.

It was built on an aluminum frame (literally just two aluminum sticks screwed together), with a landing gear made from a spring wrapped around a screw drilled through each arm of the quadcopter.

All the code is custom written for the Arduino onboard.

It is powered by a 1400mAh 3s Tattu Lipo Battery.

Hockey tape was an asset, concerning cable management and the securing of key components.

Unfortunately, I broke one of the propellors so the demo video only shows the motors spinning without propellors on them.
